# Plant-Health-Monitoring-Device
This device tells the user when a plant needs water or sunlight based on light and soil moisture sensors and two LEDs.

All PCBs were designed in Eagle by myself, manufactured through JLCPCB, and soldered using a soldering iron for assembly to create the device.
Code was created utilizing the Arduino IDE.

Version 1: Utilizes sensor modules in order to create the device (complete). Version 1 will be tested utilizing a breadboard to ensure that the setup will work for further iterations.

Version 2: Utilizes raw ICs in order to create the device (in progress).

Version 3: Will include ML processing and a display to predict when the device will need water next (based on previous data).
